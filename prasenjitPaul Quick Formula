First Step:

1. Last three years average Return on Equity(ROE) and Return on Capital Employed(ROCE) both are greater than 20%
2. Debt To Equity Ratio is less than 1. (or heavily reducing for the last few years)
3. Promoters pledge less than 10% of their total shareholdings, or there is a clear indication that it will fall below 10$ soon (better if it is NIL)
4. Last 3 years CAGR sales growth rate is more than 10%
5. Last 3 years CAGR profit growth rate is more than 12%

Second Step:
1. Valuation
  if PE ratio of more than two times of last 3 years average EPS growth then avoid the same.
2. Stock Price Movement
  a. If last three years annualised return is less than 10% and last one year's return is negative then mark as avoid
  b. if last three years annualised return and last one year's return both are negative then avoid the stock.
  c. Only consider stocks for investment having last three years annualised return is more than 10% with last one year's return is positive.
